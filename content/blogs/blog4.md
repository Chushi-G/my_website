title: About me
---

My name is Chushi Guo. Having completed my BBA degree at ESADE Business School in Spain with an exchange semester at Cornell University in the US, I decided to undertake a more specialized Master's degree in finance to deepen my understanding of different financial topics and fully prepare myself for an investment banking career. Therefore, I am currently reading for my Masters in Financial Analysis degree at London Business School in the UK.

Prior to LBS, I have completed IB internships in Germany and the UK. I enjoy immersing myself in a fast-paced banking environment where I can apply both collaborative and quantitative skills to make a positive impact. After joining LBS, I am excited to see various professional and social activities offered in the community. For example, I joined LBS impact consulting club which offered the opportunity to work in real-life consulting projects for NGO businesses alongside MBAs. Besides expanding my financial knowledge, I am looking forward to exploring various aspects (e.g. Impact Investing, PE) of the financial sector and establishing a long-lasting professional network at LBS. 

On a personal note, I love languages: I speak four languages fluently (Cantonese/Mandarin/Spanish/English) and know a bit of French. I enjoy travelling, snorkeling and food hunting in the city.
