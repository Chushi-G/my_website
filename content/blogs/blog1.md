I like food and cooking. Once, I signed up for a two-week “Food design” summer course in Vienna to acquire more insight into food making. I am also a major food lover that constantly explores different style of cuisines all over the world. During my stay in New York, I explored over 150 restaurants in less than 12 months. Moreover, I am an environmental activist. As a snorkelling amateur enthusiast, I have long been saddened because of the bleached coral and gloomy reef in the ocean. Determined to bring a positive change, I have undertaken various environmental initiatives such as helping my Chinese family and friends apply waste classification. In the far future, my ultimate career goal is ESG/social impact investing. I am keen to apply both my solid financial knowledge and practical investment banking experience to ESG investing and initiate a positive change in the severe environmental issues in the long-term.  

Furthermore, I am an active reader with a primary interest in Geopolitics and International Relations. In December 2019, I held the very first local meetup in Munich for the Finimize platform with the topic The New Silk Road. During the event, I led the discussions from the US-China trade war to monetary policy in EU, from record highs in the US stock market to the largest Saudi Aramco IPO in December, from One Belt One Road imitative to Hong Kong protests. I have not only gained valuable insights from participants but also enhanced my understandings of some of the critical global issues. Fascinated by the role Geopolitics play in modern society, I firmly stick to my reading habit and plan to hold my next Finimize meetup event with geopolitics topics in the coming months.
